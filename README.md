# UWE-Net for Underwater Image Enhancement and Composite Fusion model for Species Classification
We introduce UnderWaterEnhanceNetwork (UWE-Net), a novel underwater picture 
enhancement technique that uses a pre-trained architecture termed VGG16 as an encoder. In 
our method, we add a Convolutional Block Attention Module to the decoder's skip 
connections. This module records the image's spatial and channel-wise dependencies. We 
employ the Charbonnier loss as a measure for enhancing underwater images in order to get 
better results.
